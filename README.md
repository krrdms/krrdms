Hello all, aside from my primary professional work, I also teach cybersecurity and networking courses at the Northern Virginia Community College (primarily in Annandale, but other campuses also). I teach networking and cyber for the MIS concentration at George Mason University in Fairfax also. I have a real webpage at https://www.ja6.com.
